[BAREOS](http://www.bareos.org/) is a fork of the Bacula source code with the following
changes (highlevel):

Release 13.2.3
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos.png?branch=bareos-13.2)](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos)

* Allow to cancel multiple jobids with cancel cmd from bconsole.

* Enhanced help for run and restore command.
* Refactor windows version detection code.
* Sortable tables in bRestore.
* Windows config files admin-only access.
* Plugin framework enhancements.
* Conditionally enable VSS.
* Implement plugin options passing.
* Added usage to the plugin information block.
* Upgrade all filed plugins to use fd_common.h
* Plugin to do backup of Microsoft Sql Server (mssql) server.
* Cleanup win api compat layer.

Release 13.2.2
==============
* Remove hardcoded job timeout of 6 days.
* Remove vtape autodetection
* SD to SD replication makes SD crash
* Rework database scripting.
* Allow updates from Bacula 2.x to Bareos.
* Fix some bugs in the NDMP implementation.
* Some coverity warning and errors fixed.
* Add support for setting allowed cns for passive mode.

Release 13.1.x
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos.png?branch=bareos-13.2)](https://travis-ci.org/bareos/bareos)

* Allow cancel by JobId on storage daemon. (#13)
* Security (filed)
   * Implementation of an allowed scriptdir keyword (#31)
   * Implementation of an allowed job command keyword (#32)
* Cleanup of compression framework (#34)
* Encryption cipher is hardcoded (#46)
* Job migration/copy between different SDs (#7)
* Use open_bpipe wrapper in bpipe plugin (#104)
   * Side effect of using open_bpipe is that you can only call
     a binary or a script like all other things in Bareos e.g.
     runscripts etc. If you want to use a direct cmdline you need
     to embed the cmdline in a sh -c 'cmdline ...'
* Add firewall friendly reverse data channel initialization.
   * instead of FD connecting to SD for backup, restore and verify
     the client is defined as a passive client and the Director instructs
     the SD to connect to the FD. So no need for puching holes in your firewall
     for returning data traffic but initiate all connections from the inside to
     the outside. The default is still non passive mode but for external clients
     in an DMZ or on the Internet you can define the client as a passive client.
